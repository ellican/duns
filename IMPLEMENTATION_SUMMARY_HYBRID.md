### 3. `extractSQL($response)`
Extracts SQL query from AI response.

**Handles:** Multiple formats (with/without SQL: marker).

### 4. `validateAndCleanSQL($sql)`
Validates and secures SQL queries.

**Security:** Blocks dangerous keywords, ensures SELECT-only, adds LIMIT.

### 5. `queryOllama($question, $system_prompt, $temperature, $num_predict)`
Flexible Ollama API wrapper.

**Features:** Customizable temperature and token count.

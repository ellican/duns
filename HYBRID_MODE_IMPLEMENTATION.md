# Hybrid Mode Implementation - Before & After

## Summary of Changes

The AI assistant has been upgraded from a **database-only query tool** to a **dual-mode hybrid assistant** that combines ChatGPT-like conversational abilities with strict database integrity.

## Key Changes

### 1. System Prompt Evolution

#### Before (Database-Only):
```
You are a SQL expert for a financial management system.
Convert the user's natural language question into a SQL query.
Return ONLY the SQL query, nothing else.
```

#### After (Hybrid):
```
You are a smart and friendly financial assistant with two capabilities:

GENERAL KNOWLEDGE MODE:
- Answer general knowledge questions conversationally
- Explain accounting, finance, economics naturally
- Engage in small talk and teaching

DATABASE MODE:
- Use the company's database as the only source of truth
- Convert questions to SQL
- Never make up or imagine data
```

### 2. Response Flow

#### Before (2-Stage, Database-Only):
```
User Question → Generate SQL → Execute → Format Results → Response
```

#### After (Hybrid with Mode Detection):
```
User Question → Analyze Intent
    ↓
    ├─ General Knowledge → Direct Response
    └─ Database Query → Generate SQL → Execute → Format Results → Response
```

### 3. New Functions Added

#### `buildHybridSystemPrompt()`
Creates a comprehensive system prompt that teaches the AI to distinguish between general knowledge and database questions.

#### `containsSQLRequest($response)`
Detects if the AI's response contains a SQL query marker or starts with SELECT.

```php
function containsSQLRequest($response) {
    return (
        preg_match('/\bSQL:/i', $response) || 
        preg_match('/^\s*SELECT\s+/i', $response)
    );
}
```

#### `extractSQL($response)`
Extracts the SQL query from the AI's response, handling multiple formats.

```php
function extractSQL($response) {
    // Look for "SQL:" marker
    if (preg_match('/SQL:\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)/is', $response, $matches)) {
        return trim($matches[1]);
    }
    // Or extract SELECT statement
    if (preg_match('/^\s*(SELECT\s+.+?)(?:;|\n|$)/is', $response, $matches)) {
        return trim($matches[1]);
    }
    return null;
}
```

#### `validateAndCleanSQL($sql)`
Enhanced SQL validation with better security checks.

#### `queryOllama($question, $system_prompt, $temperature, $num_predict)`
Flexible Ollama querying with customizable parameters for different modes.

### 4. Temperature & Token Adjustments

#### Before:
```php
// SQL Generation
'temperature' => 0.1,
'num_predict' => 200,

// Response Formatting
'temperature' => 0.7,
'num_predict' => 800,
```

#### After:
```php
// General Knowledge Mode
'temperature' => 0.7,  // More creative
'num_predict' => 600,  // Longer explanations

// Database Mode (SQL Generation)
'temperature' => 0.1,  // Precise
'num_predict' => 200,  // Focused
```

### 5. Welcome Message

#### Before:
```html
<h4>👋 Hi! I'm your financial assistant</h4>
<p>Ask me anything about your financial data. I'll help you find what you need!</p>

Quick Questions:
- 💰 Latest payment
- 📊 This week's total
- 👥 Top clients
- ⚠️ Unpaid invoices
```

#### After:
```html
<h4>👋 Hi! I'm your smart financial assistant</h4>
<p>I can help you in two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>📊 Answer questions about your company data (payments, clients, revenue)</li>
  <li>🧠 Explain financial concepts and teach you about accounting</li>
</ul>
<p>Try asking me anything!</p>

Quick Questions:
- 💰 Latest payment (database)
- 🧠 Explain gross profit (general)
- 👥 Top clients (database)
- 📚 Teach me invoicing (general)
```

### 6. Response Types

#### Before:
All responses were formatted from database results.

#### After:
```json
// General Knowledge Response
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Gross profit is the amount...",
  "type": "general"
}

// Database Response
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "The latest person paid is John Doe.",
  "sql": "SELECT client_name FROM clients...",
  "type": "database"
}
```

### 7. Logging Enhancement

#### Before:
```php
logInteraction($pdo, $user_id, $query, $sql, $response);
```

#### After:
```php
logInteraction($pdo, $user_id, $query, $sql, $response, $type);
// $type can be 'general' or 'database'
```

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: General Knowledge

**User Input:**
```
What is gross profit?
```

**AI Process:**
1. Analyzes question with hybrid prompt
2. Recognizes as general knowledge question
3. Responds directly without database query

**AI Response:**
```
Gross profit is the amount a business earns after deducting the direct costs 
of producing goods or services. It shows how efficiently a company produces 
and sells its products. For example, if you sell a product for $100 and it 
costs $60 to make, your gross profit is $40.
```

**Type:** `general`  
**SQL:** `null`

---

### Example 2: Database Query

**User Input:**
```
Who is the latest person paid?
```

**AI Process:**
1. Analyzes question with hybrid prompt
2. Recognizes as database question about company data
3. Outputs: `SQL: SELECT client_name FROM clients WHERE status = 'PAID' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1`
4. System detects SQL marker
5. Extracts and validates SQL
6. Executes query
7. Formats results naturally

**AI Response:**
```
The latest person who was paid is John Doe.
```

**Type:** `database`  
**SQL:** `SELECT client_name FROM clients WHERE status = 'PAID' ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1`

---

### Example 3: Small Talk

**User Input:**
```
Hello!
```

**AI Process:**
1. Recognizes as greeting
2. Responds conversationally

**AI Response:**
```
Hello! I'm your financial assistant. How can I help you today? You can ask 
me about your company's financial data, or I can explain financial concepts 
if you'd like to learn something new.
```

**Type:** `general`  
**SQL:** `null`

---

### Example 4: Complex Database Query

**User Input:**
```
Show me top 5 clients by payment
```

**AI Process:**
1. Recognizes as database aggregation query
2. Generates SQL with GROUP BY and ORDER BY
3. Executes and formats results

**AI Response:**
```
Here are your top 5 clients by total payments: John Enterprises ($45,000), 
Mary & Co ($32,500), Felix Trading ($28,900), Kane Industries ($22,300), 
and Alice Solutions ($19,800).
```

**Type:** `database`  
**SQL:** `SELECT client_name, SUM(paid_amount) as total FROM clients GROUP BY client_name ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 5`
